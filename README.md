# z3-proofs2latex

A small script to produce a natural derivation using a z3 proof produced by the C++/Python API.

Edit the path file in either proof_unsat.py or proof_unsat.cpp to parse the smt formula.

Obtain the pdf file proof_python.pdf using
```
    $ make proof_python
```

Obtain the pdf file proof_cpp.pdf using
```
    $ make proof_cpp
```

There is an issue with the varwidth in the implementation using the proof from the Cpp api. You can change, if needed, this variable by changing _varwidth in z3-proof-parser-sexpr.y

Currently, it supports the logic "QF_UFLIA".
